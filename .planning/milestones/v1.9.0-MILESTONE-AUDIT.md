# Milestone v1.9.0 Audit Report

## Summary
**Status:** PASSED
**Goal:** Codebase Intelligence System

All planned phases (1-5) are complete and verified. The system now includes a standalone watcher daemon, a SQLite graph database for semantic intelligence, subagent-delegated indexing for scalability, and visual verification protocols.

| CONTEXT-01 | Reference Tiers | 02 | ✓ |
| CONTEXT-02 | Auto-ingestion | 02 | ✓ |
| INTEL-03 | Semantic Purpose | 02 | ✓ |
| UAT-01 | Visual Checkpoints | 03 | ✓ |
| UAT-02 | Visual Comparison | 03 | ✓ |
| HEAL-01 | Retrospective Agent | 04 | ✓ |
| INTEL-08 | Delegated Entity Gen | 05 | ✓ |
| INTEL-09 | Subagent Direct Write | 05 | ✓ |
| INTEL-10 | Path-only Context | 05 | ✓ |

## Phase Verification status

- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** PASSED. Daemon and DB functional.
- **Phase 2 (Context):** PASSED. Planner integration verified.
- **Phase 3 (Multimodal):** PASSED. Visual protocols established.
- **Phase 4 (Self-Healing):** PASSED. Retrospective command ready.
- **Phase 5 (Subagents):** PASSED. Scalable indexing verified.

## Integration Check

- **Wiring:** ALL CONNECTED.
  - Watcher -> Subagents (Verified)
  - Planner -> Graph DB (Verified)
  - Executor -> Visual Checkpoints (Verified)
  - CLI -> Retrospective (Verified)
  
- **E2E Flows:**
  - **Intelligent Planning:** Verified (Planner receives graph context).
  - **Scalable Indexing:** Verified (Watcher spawns subagents).
