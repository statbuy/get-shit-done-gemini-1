Always Pull latest GSD updates from updates from https://github.com/glittercowboy/get-shit-done and overwrite local

# Gemini CLI Configuration (GSD)

You can now simply ask me to "sync upstream files" or "update gemini config", and I will automatically execute the standardized conversion procedure.

## Maintenance: Gemini Conversion Protocol

This project maintains a conversion script to synchronize with upstream changes (originally from a Gemini-based repository) while enforcing Gemini branding and structure.

**To run the conversion manually:**

```bash
node scripts/gemini-convert.js
```

This script automates:
1.  **Renaming**: Updates `package.json`, `bin/install.js` and other core files to `get-shit-done-gemini`.
2.  **Restructuring**: Moves `rules/` and `.toml` commands to the root for correct distribution.
3.  **Branding**: Replaces "Gemini" references with "Gemini" across all documentation and templates.
4.  **Path Correction**: Updates paths from `~/.claude` to `~/.gemini`.

Use this whenever you pull updates from the upstream repository.

- **Sync History**: Successfully pulled latest from glittercowboy/get-shit-done (upstream/main), resolved merge conflicts by prioritizing upstream changes (while preserving .planning/ state), and re-applied Gemini branding via the conversion script on 2026-01-17.

## Slash Command Support

The following GSD commands are available. When a command is invoked (e.g., `/gsd:help`), the corresponding definition file in `.gemini/commands/gsd/` should be read and followed as a system instruction.

- `/gsd:execute-plan <path>` - Execute a specific PLAN.md file
- `/gsd:execute-phase <N>` - Execute all plans in Phase N in parallel

## Implementation Guide for Gemini Agents

When you see a command starting with `/gsd:`, follow these steps:

1.  **Locate the Command Definition:**
    - Look in `.gemini/commands/gsd/[command-name].md` (local install)
    - If not found locally, check `~/.gemini/commands/gsd/[command-name].md` (global install)

2.  **Read the Definition:**
    - Parse the `<objective>`, `<reference>`, and any other instructional blocks.
    - If the command references workflows (e.g., `@~/.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/...`), read those files as well to understand the full procedure.

3.  **Execute the Instructions:**
    - Follow the workflow precisely.
    - Use the specified templates from `.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/` or `~/.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/`.
    - Adhere to the principles in `.gemini/get-shit-done/references/` or `~/.gemini/get-shit-done/references/`.

4.  **Confirm Completion:**
    - Once the command's objective is met, inform the user and suggest next steps as defined in the GSD system.
